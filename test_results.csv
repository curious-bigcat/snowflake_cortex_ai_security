It states that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared.\n\nIn simpler terms, the equation shows that mass (m) and energy (E) are interchangeable; they are two sides of the same coin. This means that a certain amount of mass can be converted into a corresponding amount of energy, and vice versa.\n\nFor example, when a piece of coal is burned, its mass is converted into energy in the form of heat and light. Conversely, if you were to take a certain amount of energy (like the energy from a battery) and convert it into mass, you would get a tiny amount of matter.\n\nThe speed of light (c) is a constant, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. When you square this value (c^2), you get a"",
